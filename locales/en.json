    "whatIsIt": "<h1>What is it?</h1>  <p>Find Earth is an <a class='link' href='https://github.com/FindEarth' target='_blank'>open source</a> platform, which aims to facilitate the reporting of lost people, speed up the viralization of their data in social networks and the most important: help to find them.</p>",
    "why": "<h1>Why?</h1><p>When a person is lost, the time is worth more than normal. Through Find Earth you can report, view data and share lost people with just one click.</p><p>Usually we see tweets or facebook posts with the person information. This has some disadvantages. For example, we can't update a tweet. And if the tweet has already gone viral, it's too late.</p><p>Do you need a platform like that? Look at the statistics: in 27 days of April (2017), 28 femicides ocurred. Almost one femicide per day.</p><div class='image-wrapper'><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*5kp5-MeTa5zS1kyI3JrK8Q.png'/><span class='description'>Source: <a class='link' href='http://cosecharoja.org/femicidio-araceli' target='_blank'>http://cosecharoja.org/femicidio-araceli</a></span></div><p>When a person is lost, the first 72 hours are of the utmost importance to help find it. After this time the statistics are reduced unfavorably.</p><p>For us the awareness and collaboration of society is of the utmost importance since Find Earth is simply a tool, the medium is <b>all</b> of us.</p>"
