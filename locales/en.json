    "whatIsIt": "<h1>What is it?</h1>  <p>Find Earth is a platform <a class='link' href='https://github.com/FindEarth' target='_blank'>open source</a>, which aims to facilitate the reporting of lost people, speed up the viralization of their data in social networks and the most important: help to find them.</p>  <p>The platform is composed by 3 applications:</p>",
    "administrationWeb": "<h3>1. Administration Web</h3><p>From this website, an organization, such as <a class='link' href='http://redsolidaria.org.ar' target='_blank'>Red Solidaria</a>, can load information from lost people, receive and evaluate user complaints and view statistics in real time.</p><div class='image-wrapper'><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*zQaAv0bNMJ3d6KJhoSR_vw.png'/><span class='description'><a class='link' href='https://admin.find.earth' target='_blank'>https://admin.find.earth</a></span></div><p>This allows you to have all the information in one place, organized and easy to process. On the other hand the tool also facilitates the diffusion of images and data of the people in different social networks.</p>",
    "publicWeb": "<h3>2. Public Web</h3><p>A portal where any user can see the data of a lost person: name, age, photos and place on the map where it was last seen.</p><div class='image-wrapper'><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*w3jv0K5C2RwCRscO6IFJzQ.png'/></div>",
    "appMobile": "<h3>3. App Mobile</h3><p>This layer of the platform is still <a class='link' href='https://github.com/FindEarth/app' target='_blank'>in development</a>, but the goal is:</p><p><b>a.</b> The report of lost people</p><p><b>b.</b> Show a list of the people closest to the current position of the device</p><p><b>c.</b> Send a notification to the user when someone reported a person within a few KMs away</p><div class='image-wrapper'><img style='width: 30%; max-width: 30%;' src='/mobile-screen.png'/></div>",
    "why": "<h1>Why?</h1><p>When a person is lost, the time is worth more than normal. Through Find Earth you can report, view data and share lost people with just one click.</p><p>Do you need a platform like that? Look at the statistics: in 27 days of April occurred 28 femicides. Almost one femicide per day.</p><div class='image-wrapper'><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*5kp5-MeTa5zS1kyI3JrK8Q.png'/><span class='description'>Source: <a class='link' href='http://cosecharoja.org/femicidio-araceli' target='_blank'>http://cosecharoja.org/femicidio-araceli</a></span></div><p>When a person is lost, the first 72 hours are of the utmost importance to help find it. After this time the statistics are reduced unfavorably.</p><p>For us the awareness and collaboration of society is of the utmost importance since Find Earth is simply a tool, the medium is <b>all</b> of us.</p>"
